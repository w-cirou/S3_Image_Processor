This application is for anyone who wants a custom Image Converter for JPEG's and PNG's. An S3 bucket is created to store the image/s to be converted. The ConvertImageType function is invoked by an HTTP Request from APIGateway which contains the bucket name and image key of the image. The function then begins by searching the bucket and extracting the image once it is found. It then checks what type the image is, if it is a JPEG than it converts to the a PNG, if it is a PNG then it converts it to a JPEG. This is done by way of the internal ImageIO library in Java. After the image is converted the function creates a /converted folder in the S3 bucket, if there isn't one already, and deposits the image there, and returns a APIGateway response.
